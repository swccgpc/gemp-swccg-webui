# gemp-swccg-webui
GEMP-SWCCG WebUI - client for playing Star Wars CCG using a web browser. The program takes care of the rules so you don't have to.

This is the code running from the official webserver. If you want to run it from your own localhost server,
you'll have to set a proxy-forwarding rule in your localhost webserver to redirect all requests to
http://localhost/gemp-swccg-server/ to http://gemp.starwarsccg.org/gemp-swccg-server/
